# MPG-Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether a vehicle's attributes (such as weight, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, etc.) can be used to predict the vehicle's miles per gallon? If so, which models work the best?

## The project contains the following files:
*  [MPG Analysis Python Notebook](https://github.com/DataBaeDev/MPG-Analysis/blob/main/MPG_Analysis.ipynb)
    * EDA, Data Cleaning, Visualizations, Model Selection and Training
*  [Model Testing Python Notebook](https://github.com/DataBaeDev/MPG-Analysis/blob/main/MPG_Analysis_Model_Testing.ipynb)
    * Tests the Selected Models using randomly generated values
